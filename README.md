# My NixOS configurations

Here's my NixOS/home-manager config files. Requires [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).

Looking for something simpler to start out with flakes? Try [my starter config repo](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-config).

**Highlights**:

- **NixOS configurations**: desktop, laptop, servers
- **Opt-in persistence** through impermanence + blank snapshotting
- **Encrypted** single **BTRFS** partition (with **disko** for declarative partitioning)
- **Secure Boot** via **lanzaboote**
- Fully **declarative** **self-hosted** stuff
- Deployment **secrets** using **sops-nix**
- **Mesh networked** hosts with **tailscale** and **headscale**
- Flexible **Home Manager** configs through **feature flags**
- Extensively configured **hyprland** environment
- **Declarative** **themes** and **wallpapers**
- **Hydra CI/CD** builds every host, serves a binary cache, and hosts auto-upgrade by pull deployment


## About the installation

All my computers use a single btrfs (encrypted on all except headless systems)
partition, with subvolumes for `/nix`, a `/persist` directory (which I opt in
using `impermanence`), swap file, and a root subvolume (cleared on every boot).

Home-manager is used as a NixOS module, integrated via `home-manager.users`.


## Secrets

For deployment secrets (such as user passwords and server service secrets), I'm
using the awesome [`sops-nix`](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix). All secrets
are encrypted with my personal PGP key (stored on a YubiKey), as well as the
relevant systems's SSH host keys.

On my desktop and laptop, I use `pass` for managing passwords, which are
encrypted using (you bet) my PGP key. This same key is also used for mail
signing, as well as for SSH'ing around.

## Tooling and applications I use

Most relevant user apps daily drivers:

- hyprland + hypridle + hyprlock
- waybar
- helix
- fish
- alacritty
- qutebrowser
- neomutt + mbsync
- khal + khard + todoman + vdirsyncer
- gpg + pass
- tailscale
- podman
- zathura
- wofi
- bat + fd + rg
- kdeconnect

Some of the services I host:

- hydra
- jellyfin
- *arrs (including torrent and usenet)
- prometheus
- websites (such as https://m7.rs)
- minecraft
- headscale

Nixy stuff:

- sops-nix
- impermanence
- disko
- lanzaboote
- home-manager
- and NixOS and nix itself, of course :)

Let me know if you have any questions about them :)
